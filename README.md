# XcodeParser

A framework for parsing xcodeprojects.
The current framework only supports reading an xcode project into dictionaries.
In the future I'd like to add support for 

+ listing swift files 
+ listing objective-c files
+ listing targets
+ listing files that are in the project but not added to a target (e.g. orphaned test files due to a merge)
